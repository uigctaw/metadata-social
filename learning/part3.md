Change of plans. I will start with pure Terraform. This is because I found
a very convenient DigitalOcean tutorial. I actually started using DO, because
I would often stumble across their how-tos when searching for various
VPS-related answers.

Specifically the tutorial I'm using is:
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-terraform-with-digitalocean

Thus the first step will be 2 VMs in one data center + load balancer. The
servers will be running nginx.
