Time for containers. Docker, specifically.
First I'll try to run containerised nginx.

I did part of Docker Python tutorial. It's very new... And has serious bugs.

Nginx... I did few more exercises, corrected some issues with the Docker
Python tutorial and now I'll try to actually deploy containerised nginx for
the service I'm developing.
