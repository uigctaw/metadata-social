Time for containers. Docker, speficially.
First I'll try to run contenerized nginx.

I did part of Docker Python tutorial. It's very new... And has serious bugs.

Nginx... I did few more excercies, corrected some issues with the Docker
Python tutorial and now I'll try to actually deploy contenerized nginx for
the service I'm developing.
